- [[References]] are essentially '**safe pointers**'
- Instead of  * ,use **&**
- A [[References|reference]] **MUST** point to **existing** data, 
- and can never point to nothing/nullptr
	- This makes them (almost) always safe
- **Prefer** using [[References|reference]] to [[pointer|pointers]] wherever possible in our code
