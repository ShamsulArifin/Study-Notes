1. [[Functions|Function]] templates are just blueprints. They are not real C++ code consumed by the [[Compiler|compiler]]. The compiler generates real C++ code by looking at the arguments you call your function template with
2. The real C++ function generated by the compiler is called a `template instance` .
3. A `template instance` will be reused when a similar function call is issued. No duplicates are generated by the compiler.
