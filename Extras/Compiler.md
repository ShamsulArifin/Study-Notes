A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's [source code](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/source-code) into machine code, bytecode or another programming language. The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as [Java](https://www.theserverside.com/definition/Java) or [C++](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/C). A programmer writes the source code in a code editor or an integrated development environment ([IDE](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/integrated-development-environment)) that includes an editor, saving the source code to one or more text files. A compiler that supports the source programming language reads the files, analyzes the code, and translates it into a format suitable for the target platform.

Compilers that translate source code to [machine code](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/machine-code-machine-language) target specific operating systems and computer architectures. This type of output is sometimes referred to as object code (which is not related to [object-oriented programming](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP)). The outputted machine code is made up entirely of binary bits -- 1s and 0s -- so it can be read and executed by the processors on the target computers. For example, a compiler might output machine code for the Linux x64 platform or Linux ARM 64-bit platform.
