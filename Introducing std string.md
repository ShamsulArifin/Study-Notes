Strings are objects that represent sequences of characters.  
  
The standard string class provides support for such objects with an interface similar to that of a [standard container](https://cplusplus.com/stl) of bytes, but adding features specifically designed to operate with strings of single-byte characters.

The string class is an instantiation of the [basic_string](https://cplusplus.com/basic_string) class template that uses char (i.e., bytes) as its _character type_, with its default [char_traits](https://cplusplus.com/char_traits) and [allocator](https://cplusplus.com/allocator) types (see [basic_string](https://cplusplus.com/basic_string) for more info on the template).
